# AmpShell - Lean and fast DOSBox frontend, for Windows

The purpose of AmpShell is to make you run games in DOSBox with a simple double click. It saves the time and trouble you can have with DOS commands.

## Requirements

At least Windows XP with .NET 4.

Starting with Windows Vista, .NET 4 is provided with Windows, so you don't have to install it.

## Features

### Fast Startup

I hate having to wait for something, that's why AmpShell is simple and stupid - so it can bootup faster than I can say 'snap!'

### No Install

AmpShell has no dependency apart from .NET 4 (which is provided with Windows anyway), and therefore no installer.

Just download it, and you are ready to go.

### AutoConfig

DOSBox is automatically found, as is it's configuration file.

### Drag & Drop

You can create a new entry by dropping a file or link into the main window.

### Portable Mode

This program can also be used on a removable media, no setup required. To that end, a 'Portable Pack' (AmpShell + DOSBox preconfigured) is also provided.

### Multiple DOSBox support

The emulator we all know and love has alot of variations out there (DOSBox SVN, ECE, SVN Daum, DOSBox-X, ...), so that's why you can use another DOSBox executable and config files on a per-game basis if you need to.
