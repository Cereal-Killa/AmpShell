# AmpShell - Lean and fast DOSBox frontend, for Windows (Linux and Mac coming soon !)

The purpose of AmpShell is to make you run games in DOSBox with a simple double click. It saves the time and trouble you can have with DOS commands.

## Requirements

None, as .NET 5 is used. The application is shipped as a single executable.

For legacy Windows users, .NET 2.0 is used and required.

## Features

### Fast Startup

I hate having to wait for something, that's why AmpShell is simple and stupid - so it can bootup faster than I can say 'snap!'

### No Install

AmpShell has no dependency, and therefore no installer.

Just download it, and you are ready to go.

### AutoConfig

DOSBox is automatically found, as is its configuration file.

### Drag & Drop

You can create a new entry by dropping a file or link into the main window.

### Portable Mode

This program can also be used on a removable media, no setup required. To that end, a 'Portable Pack' (AmpShell + DOSBox preconfigured) is also provided.

### Multiple DOSBox support

The emulator we all know and love has alot of variations out there (DOSBox SVN, ECE, SVN Daum, DOSBox-X, ...), so that's why you can use another DOSBox executable and config files on a per-game basis if you need to.

### Command Line options

In this mode, AmpShell will launch the game, and exit. The GUI will be not shown.

-g to run a game (with its name or main executable path)
-s to run its setup utility
-v for verbosity
